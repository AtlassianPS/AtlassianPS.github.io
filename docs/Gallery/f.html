<h3>Description</h3>
<p>I have a colleague at work who writes HTML apps for managing due dates and sprint assignment of issues.<br/>
He was unable to figure out how to upload the data back into Jira, as the server does not allow for CORS ajax requests.<br/>
So my workaround is: his HTML app dumps the results to JSON - and a scheduled job runs the following script that persists the changes to the issues on Jira.</p>
