# Description

This release brings new functionality, improvements and bug fixes that has been submitted by our contributors.

# CHANGELOG

## IMPROVEMENTS

* Added support for paginated response from API server by means of `-Paging` (#291, [@lipkau[]])
  * moved default values to `JiraPS.psm1` so that they could be changed from outside of the module  
  _in preparation for using `Configuration`_
  * added logic for `Command parameters` > `Global defaults` > `module defaults`
  * huge improvement to Unit Tests for `Invoke-JiraMethod`
  * improved how HTTP responses > 399 are handled (`Resolve-ErrorWebResponse`)
  * added `.EXTERNALHELP` to all functions (needed for Powershell v3)
  * updated all functions which can use paging so that they use the new `-Paging` functionality
    * `Get-JiraGroupMember`
    * `Get-JiraIssue -Query`
    * `Get-JiraIssue -Filter`
    * `Get-JiraIssueComment`
    * `Get-JiraVersion`
      * added `-Sort` to influence the sorting of the results
  * added default `PageSize`
  * marked parameters which duplicate `[SupportsPaging]` parameter as **deprecated**. These are:  
    * `Get-JiraGroupMember -StartIndex`
    * `Get-JiraGroupMember -MaxResults`
    * `Get-JiraIssue -StartIndex`
    * `Get-JiraIssue -MaxResults`
  * added `-Headers` logic to `New-JiraSession`
* Updated `Pester` to version `4.3.1` (#289, [@lipkau[]])
* Added full set of functions to manage Filter Permissions (#289, [@lipkau[]])
  * introduced a new Object _`[JiraPS.FilterPermission]`_
  * added property `FilterPermissions` to _`[JiraPS.Filter]`_ which is the list of _`[JiraPS.FilterPermission]`_  of this Filter
  * introduced a new Object _`[JiraPS.ProjectRole]`_
  * added `Add-JiraFilterPermission`
  * added `Get-JiraFilterPermission`
  * added `Remove-JiraFilterPermission`
* Added `-Id` parameter to `Remove-JiraFilter` (#288, [@lipkau[]])
  * by adding `-Id` parameter (which accepts a value by pipeline), this function can now  
  be used in scenarios like `Get-Content "listOfFilter.txt | Remover-JiraFilter`
* Changed logic of `Get-JiraUser` to return multiple results for a search (#272, [@lipkau[]])
  * `Get-JiraUser` was hard-coded to return only one result, while the API can return multiple results
  * added parameter (`-MaxResults`, `-Skip`) to influence the results of the API
  * _API has a limitation of 1000 items in response_
* Added posts for homepage to the module's repository (#268, [@lipkau[]])
  * by maintaining the posts of the homepage in the module's repository, the new version of the  
  module can be deployed without manual changes to the homepage (thanks to #259 mentioned bellow)
* Improved handling of _Credentials_ (#271, [@lipkau[]])
  * added an empty _`[Credential]`_ object as default value
  * `-Credential "Username"` now uses the _`[String]`_ as value for the Username in the Credentials dialog
  * this change is important for Powershell v3 compatibility
* Added missing interactions with _Filters_ (#266, [@lipkau[]])
  * added `-Favorite` to `Get-JiraFilter`, which lists all Filters marked as favorite by the user
  * added `New-JiraFilter`
  * added `Remove-JiraFilter`
  * added `Set-JiraFilter`
* Added `Remove-JiraIssue` (#265, [@hmmwhatsthisdo[]])
* Improved Build script (to deploy changes to the homepage) (#259, [@lipkau[]])

## BUG FIXES

* Reverted `Add-JiraIssueAttachment` as JiraPS v2.7 broke it (#287, [@lipkau[]])
  * `JiraPS v2.7` tried to move the logic for generating the `multipart/form-data` to `Invoke-WebRequest`
  * this is still desired, but as it broke the functionality of `Add-JiraIssueAttachment`,  
  this was rolled-back
  * shall be fixed/re-implemented with [#284](https://github.com/AtlassianPS/JiraPS/issues/284)
* Fixed resolving of Remote Link (#286, [@lipkau[]])
  * function was using the wrong private function for converting the response to custom object
* Improved error handling for ErrorDetails and non-JSON/HTML responses (#277, [@hmmwhatsthisdo[]])
* Fully support Powershell v3 (#273, [@lipkau[]])
* Fixed parameter used in documentation but not in code (#263, [@lipkau[]])
  * added alias `-Issue` to `Get-JiraIssue -Key` as the documentation used it
  * updated documentation to use the `-Key` parameter
