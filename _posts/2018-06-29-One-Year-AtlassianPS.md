## Harmonization Between Modules

AtlassianPS had the goal to have all it's modules to have the same look&feel.  
Here are some things we achieved in this regard:

* ‚òë have a homepage which uses the data from the modules themselves to populate the information
* ‚òë have the modules publish the data of a release to the homepage
* ‚òë have the modules use [platyPS](https://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS) to generate ExternalHelp (MAML) which is displayed in Powershell's `Get-Help` and on the homepage
* ‚òë have the same module structure, repository setup and build script
* ‚òë have new release to be announced on the homepage and on slack
* ‚òë have all modules using the same code styling (_enforced with VSCode `settings.json` and Pester tests_)
* ‚òë have all modules tested against all Powershell versions supported (v3, v4, v5, v5.1, v6-on Windows, v6-on Linux, v6-on OSX) _almost finished_
